-> main diffrence that typescript creates here is that we have to specify type here also
-> Always try to name the folder in the small case.
-> always name the files as page.tsx and layout.tsx 
-> the folder name is automatically set as routes 
-> if you make two, three ... no. of the pages and layouts, all will be rendered on the page
-> Layouts ki cheeze har page pe rahti hain 
-> "use client"  -->  We have to write this whenever there is a ui manipulation or we want to use react hooks.
-> whenever we use <a></a>, page reloads so we use link to avoid that.
-> why we use link in nextjs ?
-> In Next.js, the <Link> component is used for client-side navigation between different pages of your application. It provides several benefits over traditional <a> tags, such as:
    client side rendering
    SEO friendly etc.
-> Adding Dark mode to the tailwind.config.ts by : darkMode:'class', just before theme
